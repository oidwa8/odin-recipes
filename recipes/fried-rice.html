        <ul>
            <li>Day-old rice or rice kept in the fridge</li>
            <li>Cabbage</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Green onion</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Chinese sausage</li>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (or any neutral oil)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>MSG</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice green onion, cabbage, chinese sausage. Chop garlic, onion and grate ginger.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pan or wok to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add chinese sausage, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Once browned and a good amount of oil starts to flow out, add ground beef and turn heat to high.</li>
            <li>Break down ground beef to smaller pieces and keep frying. (Water will start to come out. Keep frying on high heat to evaporate water. The loud sizzling will brown it.)</li>
            <li>Once browned and almost cooked, remove meat without draining remaining oil.</li>
            <li>Turn heat down to medium-high. Add garlic, onion, green onion and ginger and stir-fry for about thirty seconds.</li>
            <li>Add cabbage and cook until soft and/or gently charred.</li>
            <li>Turn heat to high. Add rice and mix. Season with salt, pepper and MSG. Keep stir-frying.</li>
            <li>Add meats and egg. Fry until rice is dry.</li>
        </ol>
